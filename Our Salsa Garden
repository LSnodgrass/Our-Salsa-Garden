Our Salsa Garden

Beans, Strawberries and Sunflowers
Growing along a serpentine wall
In the morning they get light from the sun
and they get wind
they start to grow flowers today
they'll grow into a strawberry, a bean, or a sunflower

Our family visits the garden before we load into the car
But the flowers are visited by others
Bees and Bugs and ants and sometimes butterflies
I know a bug
A caterpiller, a worm, a bird, flies 
and sometimes people walking by

Yes, yes we sing to the flowers
to make them grow
and that's all I know.
and that's all I know.

Now can we go read Ivy and Bean?
Can we read Ivy and Bean now?
Can we read Ivy and Bean now?

Ok
